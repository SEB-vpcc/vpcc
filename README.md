# Video Point Cloud Coding (V-PCC) AR Demo

This software provides an experimental implementation for decoding and AR rendering of bitstreams encoded with the upcoming ISO/IEC standard for video-based point cloud compression (ISO/IEC 23090-5).

## Contents of the Repository

* Demo application source code
* Demo content

Note: We currently support only TMC 13.0 version (https://github.com/MPEGGroup/mpeg-pcc-tmc2) and C2 intra coding conditions (lossy geometry, lossy attributes). The dimensions of the encoded video frames shall not change over an encoded sequence.
